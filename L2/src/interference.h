/* interference plan

takes in a function that has had liveness analysis performed on it (Function_l)

produces a Function_i (function with interference analysis performed on it)

problem: there are likely to be registers included that aren't in the function which would throw the representation off

add everything already used in the function
	- map each size_t to an integer index in the matrix (that map will live in the Function_i struct)
check each of the registers in caller_save and callee_save (in f_l) and if the hash is not already in the map, add it
then start interference analysis
